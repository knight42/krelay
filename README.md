## âœ¨Highlights

* Supports UDP port forwarding
* Supports simultaneous forwarding of data to multiple targets.
* Forwarding data to the given IP or hostname that is accessible within the kubernetes cluster
  * You could forward a local port to a port in the `Service` or a workload like `Deployment` or `StatefulSet`, and the forwarding session will not be interfered even if you perform rolling updates.
  * The hostname is resolved inside the cluster, so you don't need to change your local nameserver or modify the `/etc/hosts`.

## Demo

> [!NOTE]
> The forwarding session is not affected after rolling update.

### Forwarding traffic to a IP or hostname

### Forwarding traffic to multiple targets

```bash
$ cat > targets.txt <<EOF
# Each line in the file represents a target, the syntax is the same as the command line.
# Empty line or line starts with '#' or '//' will be ignored.

# namespace of the object can be specified by the -n flag
-n kube-system svc/kube-dns 10053:53@udp

# The default namespace is used if no namespace is specified
svc/nginx 8080:80

host/redis.cn-north-1.cache.amazonaws.com 6379
EOF

$ kubectl relay -f targets.txt
```

### Customize the forwarding server

You can provide a merge patch in JSON or YAML format to customize the forwarding server. For instance:
```bash
$ cat patch.yaml
metadata:
  generateName: foo-
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    your-key: your-value

$ kubectl --patch-file patch.yaml svc/nginx 8080:80
```

|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/)     | `kubectl krew install relay`                                   |
| [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)          | `brew install knight42/tap/krelay`                             |

> [!NOTE]
> If you only have limited access to the cluster, please make sure the permissions specified in [rbac.yaml](./manifests/rbac.yaml)
is granted:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knight42/krelay/main/manifests/rbac.yaml
# Edit rbac.yaml to update the user name
vim rbac.yaml
kubectl create -f rbac.yaml
```

### Build from source

```
git clone https://github.com/knight42/krelay
cd krelay
make krelay
cp krelay "$GOPATH/bin/kubectl-relay"
kubectl relay -V
```

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> Starting from version v0.1.2, `krelay` attempts to tunnel SPDY through websocket, in line with how `kubectl port-forward` works.
>
> This behavior can be disabled by setting the environment variable `KUBECTL_PORT_FORWARD_WEBSOCKETS` to `false`.

```bash
# Listen on port 8080 locally, forwarding data to the port named "http" in the service
kubectl relay service/my-service 8080:http

# Listen on a random port locally, forwarding udp packets to port 53 in a pod selected by the deployment
kubectl relay -n kube-system deploy/kube-dns :53@udp

# Listen on port 5353 on all addresses, forwarding data to port 53 in the pod
kubectl relay --address 0.0.0.0 pod/my-pod 5353:53

# Listen on port 6379 locally, forwarding data to "redis.cn-north-1.cache.amazonaws.com:6379" from the cluster
kubectl relay host/redis.cn-north-1.cache.amazonaws.com 6379

# Listen on port 5000 and 6000 locally, forwarding data to "1.2.3.4:5000" and "1.2.3.4:6000" from the cluster
kubectl relay ip/1.2.3.4 5000@tcp 6000@udp

# Customized the server, and forward local port 5000 to "1.2.3.4:5000"
kubectl relay --patch '{"metadata":{"namespace":"kube-public"},"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"k": "v"}}}' ip/1.2.3.4 5000

```

## How It Works

`krelay` will install an agent(named `krelay-server`) to the kubernetes cluster, and the agent will forward the traffic to the target ip/hostname.

If the target is an object in the cluster, like `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `krelay` will automatically select a pod it managed like `kubectl port-forward` does.
After that `krelay` will tell the destination IP(i.e. the pod's IP) and the destination port to the agent by sending a special `Header` first,
and then the data will be forwarded to the agent and sent to the target address.

Specifically, if the target is a `Service`, `krelay` will try to determine the destination address automatically:
* If the `Service` has a clusterIP, then the clusterIP is used as the destination IP.
* If the type of `Service` is `ExternalName`, then the external name is used as the destination address.
* If none of the above scenario is met, then `krelay` will choose a pod selected by this `Service`.

The `Header` looks like this:

|            | Version | Header Length | Request ID | Protocol | Destination Port | Address Type | Address  |
|------------|---------|---------------|------------|----------|------------------|--------------|----------|
| Byte Count | 1       | 2             | 5          | 1        | 2                | 1            | Variable |

* `Version`: This field is preserved for future extension, and it is not in-use now.
* `Header Length`: The total length of the `Header` in bytes.
* `Request ID`: The ID of the request.
* `Protocol`: The protocol of the request, `0` stands for TCP and `1` stands for UDP.
* `Destination Port`: The destination port of the request.
* `Address Type`: The type of the destination address, `0` stands for IP and `1` stands for hostname.
* `Address`: The destination address of the request:
  * 4 bytes for IPv4 address
  * 16 bytes for IPv6 address
  * Variable bytes for hostname
